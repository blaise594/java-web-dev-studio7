public class CD {
    //  Write down details about how these behaviors differ for CDs and DVDs.
    // Spinning:
    // DVD spins 3 times faster than a CD
    // Reading
    // DVD offers more data to read than CD, DVD includes audio and video data, CD just audio
    // Differences in time it takes to read, amount of data available to read
    // Writing
    // DVD can be written with audio files as well as video, CD can only be written with video
    // Differences in time it takes to write, amount of data that can be written

    //  This guides your thinking about how each class should override the methods.

    // Differences:
    // TODO: Override spin method to indicate: Transfer rate slower than DVD
    // Capacity will be less than DVD
    // More detail in data, holds:
    //  audio data
    // TODO: Implement your custom interface.

    // TODO: Determine which fields, methods, and constructors can be extended from the base class and which ones
    //  need to be declared separately.
